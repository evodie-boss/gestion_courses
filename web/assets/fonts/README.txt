Place here the Roboto font files (WOFF2) used by the web app.

Expected filenames (used by index.html):
- Roboto-Regular.woff2
- Roboto-Bold.woff2

Where to get them:
- Download from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and pick WOFF2 files, or use the Roboto GitHub repository.

After placing them here, run:
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html

If you want, I can download these files for you (needs network permission).
